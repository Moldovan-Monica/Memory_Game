# Memory_Game

When playing memory games, adults have a biological disadvantage compared to five or six-year-old children because younger children have better spatial-visual memory, which is important for memory. Another reason is that younger children have more synapses in the brain (about 200 trillion) than adults, who have to settle for about half of them.

At the onset of puberty, there is a real growth spurt, especially in the prefrontal cortex, but later on, brain connections become more rigid and are not as flexible. In lifelong learning, something like synaptic highways develops in the brain, on which thinking moves faster. This makes cognitive processes more efficient and simpler.

Even though they may not know it at the time, children enjoy exercising their memory and recognition skills while playing fun memory games. In fact, today, more schools incorporate interactive memory games into their regular curriculum models as a way to help children's brains stay alert, improve their concentration, increase memory power, and support cognitive development. Therefore, the aim of this project is to allow training of both visual and auditory memory in a fun and recreational way.

Memory games are based on solid science and are considered one of the best practices to ensure that our brains are functioning at their best. It has even been found that they have beneficial effects on dyslexic children in terms of increasing cognitive development, attention, brain activity, working memory, recall, and reading performance.



# Description of the project with Arduino components

Using the Arduino IDE application, I have programmed the Arduino Uno R3 Atmega328P development board. I have attached a breadboard to this board, on which LEDs, resistors, a buzzer, and buttons will be placed. The Arduino board is powered and data is transferred to it via a USB Type A-B cable.

The game consists of reproducing the color sequence by pressing the button next to the LED. It is structured into 100 levels, with increasing difficulty as you progress. It trains both visual and auditory memory, thanks to the buzzer which produces a specific sound (a musical note) for each LED.

# Advantages Over Existing Solutions

The development of cognitive skills is essential as a child matures, as they are not only capable of learning new information but also of remembering, thinking more critically, and processing what they learn to apply it progressively. However, since all children are different, some may not reach the milestones of age-appropriate cognitive skills, and this is where memory-building activities are useful, as a child needs a stimulating environment to develop their brain, boost their confidence, concentration, and attention.

That's why my game sets itself apart from other games, as it can be easily modified and adapted for each child.
